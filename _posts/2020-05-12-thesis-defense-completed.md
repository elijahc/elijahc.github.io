Well, it finally happened.

I'm currently finalzing edits but if you want to read the whole thing I've been experimenting with [bookdown](http://bookdown.org) and published a (currently outdated) [web](http://thesis.elijahc.net) version but there's also a [pdf](http://thesis.elijahc.net/thesis.pdf)

I joined the [jzLab](http://jzlab.org) early in 2017 and man has time flown by since then.
