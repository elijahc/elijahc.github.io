 I came across [this checklist](https://starcircleacademy.com/2010/11/stackers-checklist/) for setting up and taking startrail photos.
 I've modified it slightly based on my own workflow.

# Star trail Checklist

## Site Selection

- Sunrise, Sunset, Moonrise, Moonset and moon phase all known.
- [Light polution](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/)

## Equipment

- Camera
- Tripod + release plate
- Camera batteries
- Memory card
- (Wide angle) Lens + lens hood
- Intervalometer + batteries
- Rain protection
- Tripod Weights
- Headlamp
- Flashlight/torch
- Stuff for lightpainting

## On Site

- No leaning (center column should be vertical) â€“ leg locks tightened
- Camera aimed, leveled
- Camera locked onto tripod. Head tightened
- Tripod weighted/secure and everything is wobble free. Keep the tripod low and out of the wind for best stability. Do not extend the center column.
- Intervalometer and any other cord, or wiring also secure. Velcro on the intervalometer and the tripod leg is a handy trick.
- Save GPS coordinates and/or mark site with glow stick / other?

## Camera Settings

Setting              | Value
-------------------- | --------------------------------
Mode                 | Bulb
ISO                  | 800 (Ideally not more than 1600)
Exposure             | Single Exposure
LCD brightness       | As low as possible
Image Review         | OFF
Image Format         | RAW
WB                   | daylight (Just not Auto)
Aperature            | f/4 (f/2.8 - f/7.1)
Auto focus           | OFF
Image Stabilization  | OFF
Noise Reduction      | OFF
Mirror Lockup        | OFF
AEB                  | OFF

## Timer Setup and Test

Setting              | Value
-------------------- | --------------------------------
Delay                | None
Exposure Time        | 2' (2' total interval is a good starting point)
Interval             | 1"
Num exposures        | >= 120

> PRO TIP: Test timer; Verfiy second shot starts before canceling

## Focus and Final Framing

- Check image composition, field of view
- Set camera to Aperature priority mode if still light
- Take several bracketed shots in daylight or twilight
> PRO TIP: if it is already dark take a high ISO shot (ISO=2000; 30sec)

## Battery and Card Shuffle

- Make sure memory card has enough space
- Take second set of bracketed shots
- Return camera to Manual/Bulb mode
- Verify all settings are correct

## Final Steps

- Recheck for wobble
- Set DELAY appropriately so it starts or ends at twilight
- Secure cables
- Make sure battery and memory card access is unencumbered
- Switch to AP, take a single image, **re-verify focus**
- Switch back to Bulb
- Start timer
- If possible, wait for first 2 shots
> You can leave lens cap on for the first few exposures to collect DARK frames

I recently took a trip out to Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and shot a series of images I stacked into this:
