### Child Health Clinic (CHC)

>So CHC (regardless of the Pod you're in) is only doing healthy visits between 8-4, so you will be seeing well child checks almost exclusively.
>You're not assigned to a specific provider (at least I wasnt either day) and so theres a chance you can get lost in the mix being sent from one provider to another throughout the day.
>My suggestion is to try to ask one of the residents/attendings at the beginning of the day if you can follow them throughout the day so you can at least prep for their patients and ask them about seeing patients on your own.
