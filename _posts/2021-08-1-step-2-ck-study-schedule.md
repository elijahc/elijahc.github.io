# Resources
These are the study resources I used while studying for Step 2 CK

## UWorld
- Most of my dedicated study period I spent doing UWorld questions on random and timed mode.
- Took notes on a word doc

## OnlineMedEd (OME)
- Great supplemental resource
- Highly recommend their $25 quick tables book

## Practice Exams

UWorld self-assesments (UWSA), NBME practice exams, and free 120 practice questionns from USMLE.org.


- UWSA 1: Good predictor one month out (overestimates by 15-25)
- UWSA 2: Best predictor 1 week out (overestimates by 0-5)
- NBME 6: Good predictor 1 month out (overestimates by 10-20)
- NBME 7: Underestimates by 5-15pts
- NBME 8: Good predictor one week out (underestimates by 0-5)

### Recommendations based on number of planned practice exams
1. UWSA 2 (1wk out)
2. NBME 8 (after a studying 1-2 wks), UWSA 2 (1wk out)
3. UWSA 1 (baseline), NBME 8, UWSA 2
4. UWSA 1 (baseline), NBME 6/7, NBME 8, UWSA 2

# Daily Schedule
