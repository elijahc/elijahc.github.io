Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly comorbid with sleep dysfunction. In contrast to
motor symptoms, few therapeutic interventions exist to address sleep symptoms in
PD. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) treats advanced PD
motor symptoms and may improve sleep architecture. As a proof of concept toward
demonstrating that STN‐DBS could be used to identify sleep stages commensurate
with clinician‐scored polysomnography (PSG), we developed a novel artificial neural
network (ANN) that could trigger targeted stimulation in response to inferred sleep
state from STN local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from implanted DBS electrodes.
STN LFP recordings were collected from nine PD patients via a percutaneous cable
attached to the DBS lead, during a full night's sleep (6–8 hr) with concurrent
polysomnography (PSG). We trained a feedforward neural network to prospectively
identify sleep stage with PSG‐level accuracy from 30‐s epochs of LFP recordings. Our
model's sleep‐stage predictions match clinician‐identified sleep stage with a mean
accuracy of 91% on held‐out epochs. Furthermore, leave‐one‐group‐out analysis also
demonstrates 91% mean classification accuracy for novel subjects. These results,
which classify sleep stage across a typical heterogenous sample of PD patients, may
indicate spectral biomarkers for automatically scoring sleep stage in PD patients with
implanted DBS devices. Further development of this model may also focus on adapting stimulation during specific sleep stages to treat targeted sleep deficits.
