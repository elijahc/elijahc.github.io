## Introduction

Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a low-cost low-risk intervention in which repeated cycles of upper extremity ischemia induce organ protection by an unknown mechanism. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that RIPC improves patient outcomes, but only in the absence of propofol1. In addition to medications, patient factors such as diabetes reduce the efficacy of RIPC2. There is a critical need to better understand the mechanism of RIPC to optimize organ protection prior to surgical procedures. Towards this end, we used mass spectrometry based metabolomic profiling to determine the metabolic response to RIPC in healthy volunteers.

## Methods

### Sample collection and processing 

We performed one cycle of RIPC in healthy volunteers and sampled blood before RIPC and at 9 time points after RIPC (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes). We performed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry on samples from 30 healthy volunteers (15 male and 15 female, 300 total samples) as reported previously3. 33 metabolites were measured with absolute quantification by referencing to stable isotope labelled standards spiked into the samples at known quantification. We also performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis using automated feature detection software (Compound Discoverer) to detect 73,815 features.

### Normalization and feature scaling

Untargeted features and absolute metabolomic quantifications from each patient’s plasma samples were normalized by the first timepoint sample (baseline) and scaled by base-2 logarithm to get log2(fold-change). Log2(fold-change) mean and variance across all 30 patients were calculated at each timepoint and Welch’s t-test was used to calculate significance of each metabolite and feature fold-change. Mean log2(fold-change) and statistical p-values were used to produce volcano plots for each sampling timepoint.

### Untargeted feature clustering

Statistically significant (p < 0.01) fold change profiles over time were clustered using Isomap dimensionality reduction4. Th five distinct clusters or groups of features were observed after Isomap embedding. Features belonging to each of the five groups were combined and fold-change profiles were plotted over time by sex. Molecular weight scatter plots of each feature group were also produced. Feature group profiles were compared to several profiles from absolute metabolomic quantifications.

## Results

Absolute quantification of metabolites demonstrated a significant difference between the sexes in the levels of glutamate after RIPC (Fig 1D). Males had significantly higher glutamate after RIPC compared to females which persisted at the 60 minute time point (Fig 1D). Out of 73,815 features detected, untargeted clustering of 2248 significant features revealed 5 distinct groups that changed in response to RIPC. The majority of features and 4/5 clusters decrease in response to RIPC (Fig 1B).

## Conclusion

RIPC induces a significant reduction in metabolism as measured by a decrease in the majority of metabolites that persists for at least 60 minutes. We noted significantly lower glutamate levels in females after RIPC. RIPC may induce organ protection by reducing oxygen requirements through a systemic reduction in metabolism.
