2018-09-03	Inferring sleep stage from local field potentials recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's patients	Journal of Sleep Research	We trained a feedforward neural network to prospectively identify sleep stage with PSG‐level accuracy from 30‐s epochs of LFP recordings in human PD patients	<strong>Christensen, E</strong>; Abosch, A; Thompson, JA; Zylberberg, J	10.1111/jsr.12806	http://www.jzlab.org/Christensen_JSleepResearch2018_LFP_ANN_DBS.pdf
2020-12-08	Models of primate ventral stream that categorize and visualize images	Unpublished	We show that computational models that identify objects while also retaining enough information about the input image to allow its reconstruction, can provide a better description of how primate VS represents this category-orthogonal information, than do models that “just” identify objects	<strong>Christensen, E</strong>; Zylberberg, J	10.1101/2020.02.21.958488	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.958488v3.full.pdf
